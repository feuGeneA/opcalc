As a user, I want to press Enter on my keyboard to submit the form, so that I don't have to use the mouse, nor tab/space.

Release version 0.1.

As a developer, I want an automated test of the web page interface, so that I don't have to test it manually.  (Likely use selenium/html_unit.)

As a user, I want a modern look and feel (>=Web 2.0), or at least a field-aligned visual layout. (Move HTML template, from static string in FormView::FormView()'s call to WTemplateFormView::setTemplateText(), to an external resource file.)

As a user, I want to select an expiration date from a calendar widget, so that I don't have to manually calculate the fraction of the year from now at which the option contract will expire.

Release version 0.2.

As a user, I want to enter implied volatility, and have the calculator determine the option value from that, so that I can determine values from my own volatility opinions.

As a system administrator, I don't want memory leaks. (Pointers and new's are used everywhere, modeled after the Wt examples, but there are literally zero delete's, so it seems there are memory leaks.)

As a user, I don't want the help text to disappear when I submit the form, so that I can refer back to it again without refreshing the page.

As a user, I want the form to validate my inputs, and give me useful information on any validation failures, so that when something doesn't work as expected I'll have the information I need to correct my mistake and continue using the product.

Release version 1.0.

As a developer, I want `make` to know about my include dependencies, so that I don't get segfaults, for example when you update FormModel.h and don't recompile FormView.cpp. (use GNU autotools? explicitly declare dependencies in Makefile?)

As a developer, I want the code to check all Wt API return codes, so that I know no API is being mis-used or taken for granted.

As a developer, I want a unit test of the OpCalcApplication class, so that I can be confident that that interface works without having to manually test the application. (Possibly use Wt::Test::WTestEnvironment::startRequest(), which according to the doc "Simulates the start of a new request by the main event loop")

As a developer, I want the unit tests to cover more corner/edge case and have more basic sanity checks, so that the code will be less fragile.
